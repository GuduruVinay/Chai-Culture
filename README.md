# Chai-Culture

A brand that brings the royal tradition of Indian chai to the world. Our heritage, authenticity, and story are at the core of everything we do.

## Design Choices

**Aesthetic Direction:** I chose a refined, luxurious aesthetic that balances traditional Indian royal heritage with modern web design. The page features warm, regal color palette (golds, deep browns, creams) with subtle animations.

**Typography:** Cormorant Garamond for headlines provides a sophisticated, editorial feel that speaks to tradition and quality, while Tenor Sans for body text ensures readability with a touch of refinement. This pairing creates visual hierarchy while maintaining the premium brand identity.

**Distinctive Elements:** Floating logo with radial glow effects, decorative chai/leaf emoji elements and gradient shine animations on the CTA badge create an immersive, memorable experience that stands apart from generic landing pages.
